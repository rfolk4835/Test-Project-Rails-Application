# Test Project Rails Application

### Overview

-	Tasked to make a Ruby-on-Rails like database using python
-	Suggested to use either Django or Flask, chose Django
-	Could choose between PostgreSQL or SQLite, switch between the two
-	Originally given 3 hours to complete, time limit later removed
-	Steps included:
  o	Creating the Django database
  o	Implement a new custom user
  o	Add a user controller
  o	Add a way to view usersâ€™ specific information in an index using JSON
  o	Support a query/search feature on the users last name,
  o	Have tests for the controller and these two views 

### Successes 

-	Learned how to use Django at a basic level
-	Maintained frequent contact with mentor throughout process 
-	Asked questions where necessary when unable to find answers 
-	Repository updates had concise and informative comments
-	Tried multiple solutions before arriving at a final one
-	Gained confidence in the interview process
-	When given guidance, able to quickly understand and iterate on new code

### Challenges 

-	Time limit concern was unjustified, and caused stress in the early stages
-	Django unfamiliarity caused a significant amount of downtime
-	Frustration in unfamiliarity lead to procrastination
-	Programming return to form was slow due to inactive coding 
-	Infrequent testing, resulting in unknown code viability
-	Individual performance not as robust as being collaborative 

### Summary

-	Communication and iteration were a core part of the workflow
-	Time management issues, and lack of pre-research lead to large delays
-	For future projects, research ahead of time where possible on concepts unfamiliar, and work collaboratively when available
